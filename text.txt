I got a chance to Taipei Medical University Hospital for a part time job at
this winter vacation. This opportunity is form my thematic advisor who
was in charge of updating the information system of NTU Hospital. And
now he is the advisor of TMUH, so he knew that the hospital is going to
updating their information system during Chinese New Year.

This job was started at 1/27. The first day I went to the hospital with my
classmate who work with me, there was nothing to do for us. Because
almost all process of the new information system had be done. The only
thing we could do was collecting all the testing data and assorting them
by date. Although there were lots of data, it still be done in just two days.
So we started to be boring until the first day of Chinese New year, and
also the day of the new system would be updated.
